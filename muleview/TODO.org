* Misc:
** TODO Check data correctness
** DONE Support for more than 2-3 retentions?
** TODO Refactor / naming, "Graph" object
 - Graph object will contain references to 2 charts + alerts
 - Distinguish "chart", "graph" and "retention"
** DONE Get rid of Muleview.Events
in favor of this.application.whatever
** TODO Fix rare tootip "surface" error davar
** Ideas:
*** Experiment with union-graph
One graph to rule them all ( all retentions )
*** PASS - Experiment with single graph component
the single graph component is a panel containing a chart and can have two viewing mode - big and light
Think i'll pass this one
*** PASS - Experiment with docked buttons instead of a tab bar
*** Experiment with tree-grid
Instead of having regular tree + tabs, use tree-grid, which will hold 3 (?) buttons for each node, button per graph/retention
*** Color tree keys according to what they appear in the legend
*** Slideshow
Add an option to save and manage a list of graphs and when played, switch between them with an interval
*** Split Screen
Add an option to see 4 or 9 graphs at the same time
