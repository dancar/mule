* Issues
** DONE Graphs look awful in Firefox
** TODO Navigation in compare-mode
** TODO Status bar doesn't have busy icon
** DONE Fix statusbar auto fade
it gets into "ready" even though still waiting for mule events
** DONE Coffee 1.6 compatibility
** TODO Refresh timer not reset by reloading graph
** DONE "Loading" mask has double icons
** DONE Subkeys pagination
*** DONE Handle case when no subkeys
*** DONE Disable subkeys selector when no subkeys
** DONE prettier combobox in chart viewer
** DONE AlertsEditor not complete
** DONE The tool tip over the stack graph shows the % sign with no value
** DONE Times should be shown in UTC

* Features:
** DONE Fix Tooltip Errors somehow
** TODO Loading mask when loading keys
** DONE Url Navigation:
*** DONE Fix history-landing keys Tree
When entering Muleview with a graph url, the keys-tree doesn't update nicely.p
It should immediately show the full path of the key, and then subsequently load the full tree up to the root
** DONE Color pallete
** DONE Dymamic Tree improvements:
*** DONE Show loading mask in node itself
** DONE The x-axis contains full time stamps which can be too much for the eye. What about showing the day only when they change?
I hope this fix is suitable (Not trivial to check).
** TODO We should add some branding to the status bar. Maybe the project name and a link to github?
** TODO Pointer cursor for clickable areas
** TODO Alert dashboard - a summary of the alert statuses. Navigating to the faulty graphs would be great.
** DONE When presenting single graphs (i.e. not stacked) the lines should be thicker.
** DONE Add an option to reset the zoom factor
** DONE Toggle Legend
** TODO Color alert fieldLabels
** TODO Configurable refresh
** DONE Mule/Hinny picture
** TODO Something nicer with the status bar
** TODO Support for timestamp labels - Waiting for Mule API
** TODO Something cooler with tooltips?
** TODO Theme
*** DONE Favicon
*** DONE Areas color pallete
*** TODO Nicer Mule Background
"The mule picture should at least have the full "l" letter. I think it looks more like a bull than a mule so maybe adding another ear or a face will work."

*** TODO Different color for topKey and areas
*** TODO Less ugly keysTree icons
** DONE Redesign display
 - [X] Only relevant small graphs
 - [X] Make small graphs clickable
** DONE Url navigation
** TODO Maximize/restore button
** DONE Nicer title(s)
** DONE Status Bar
** DONE Refresh interval
** DONE Click to zoom graphs
** DONE Refresh button
** DONE Improve progress bar
 - [X] Overlay only on main panel
** DONE Shorter key names in legend
** DONE Alerts:
*** DONE Display lines on graphs
 - [X] Show lines
 - [X] Design lines
 - [X] Get rid of legend line markers
*** DONE Enable configuration
 - [X] Save
 - [X] Read
 - [X] Stale/Period:
   - [X] Save
   - [X] Read
   - [X] Special controller / Validations
*** DONE Enable removing alerts
*** DONE Do not show fields when not alerts
aka "Add alerts" button
*** DONE Nicer tips
*** DONE Load alerts with graph
* Optimizations:
** DONE Dynamic tree
** TODO Try to implement onhashchange event myself
This is related to histoy controller
** DONE Generate big chart only on demand
** DONE Upgrade to Extjs 4.2
* Misc:
** TODO Check data correctness
** DONE Support for more than 2-3 retentions?
** TODO Refactor / naming, "Graph" object
 - Graph object will contain references to 2 charts + alerts
 - Distinguish "chart", "graph" and "retention"
** DONE Get rid of Muleview.Events
in favor of this.application.whatever
** TODO Fix rare tootip "surface" error davar
** Ideas:
*** Experiment with union-graph
One graph to rule them all ( all retentions )
*** PASS - Experiment with single graph component
the single graph component is a panel containing a chart and can have two viewing mode - big and light
Think i'll pass this one
*** PASS - Experiment with docked buttons instead of a tab bar
*** Experiment with tree-grid
Instead of having regular tree + tabs, use tree-grid, which will hold 3 (?) buttons for each node, button per graph/retention
PASS - since I eventually implemented compare mode.
*** Color tree keys according to what they appear in the legend
*** Slideshow
Add an option to save and manage a list of graphs and when played, switch between them with an interval
Now even easier in compare-mode checkboxes
*** Split Screen
Add an option to see 4 or 9 graphs at the same time
Now even easier in compare-mode checkboxes
