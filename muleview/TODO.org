* Issues
** DONE Graphs look awful in Firefox
** DONE Fix statusbar auto fade
it gets into "ready" even though still waiting for mule events
* Features:
** DONE Fix Tooltip Errors somehow
** DONE Url Navigation:
*** DONE Fix history-landing keys Tree
When entering Muleview with a graph url, the keys-tree doesn't update nicely.p
It should immediately show the full path of the key, and then subsequently load the full tree up to the root
** DONE Color pallete
** DONE Dymamic Tree improvements:
*** DONE Show loading mask in node itself
** TODO Clicking alerts focuses them on the editor
** TODO Toggle Legend
** TODO Color alert fieldLabels
** TODO Configurable refresh
** TODO Mule/Hinny picture
** TODO Something nicer with the status bar

** TODO "This key has no graphs"
Not sure this is a reasonable situation, though
** TODO Support for timestamp labels - Waiting for Mule API
** TODO Something cooler with tooltips?
** TODO Theme
*** DONE Favicon
*** DONE Areas color pallete
*** TODO Different color for topKey and areas

** DONE Url navigation
** DONE Maximize/restore button
** DONE Nicer title(s)
** DONE Status Bar
** DONE Refresh interval
** DONE Click to zoom graphs
** DONE Refresh button

*** DONE Enable removing alerts
*** DONE Do not show fields when not alerts
aka "Add alerts" button
*** DONE Nicer tips
*** DONE Load alerts with graph
* Optimizations:
** DONE Dynamic tree
** TODO Try to implement onhashchange event myself
This is related to histoy controller
** TODO Generate big chart only on demand
** TODO Upgrade to Extjs 4.2
** TODO Smooth refresh
Refrehs instead of completely destroy and recreated all graphs - ask for updated data and when received, replace existing.
both in refresh button and alerts editor
* Misc:
** TODO Check data correctness
** TODO Support for more than 2-3 retentions?
** TODO Refactor / naming, "Graph" object
 - Graph object will contain references to 2 charts + alerts
 - Distinguish "chart", "graph" and "retention"
** TODO Get rid of Muleview.Events
in favor of this.application.whatever
** TODO Fix rare tootip "surface" error davar
** Ideas:
*** Experiment with union-graph
One graph to rule them all ( all retentions )
*** Experiment with single graph component
the single graph component is a panel containing a chart and can have two viewing mode - big and light
Think i'll pass this one
*** Experiment with docked buttons instead of a tab bar
*** Experiment with tree-grid
Instead of having regular tree + tabs, use tree-grid, which will hold 3 (?) buttons for each node, button per graph/retention
*** Color tree keys according to what they appear in the legend
*** Slideshow
Add an option to save and manage a list of graphs and when played, switch between them with an interval
*** Split Screen
Add an option to see 4 or 9 graphs at the same time
