* Issues
** TODO Alerts' lines go in the back of surfaces
** TODO Welcome, Rickshaw
  ** Legend can be toggled via HTML, no need to re-render  graph
** DONE Masking when opening new graph before receiving retentions
** DONE Don't make the zoom interactive
   Apply it only after mouse up
** TODO Critical-up icon missing
   In alerts summary
** DONE Discrepancy in tooltips/graph
   http://v2.mule.trusteer.net/mule/#file_storer.stored.patch_sentry_agg_patch_detected;1h:90d
** DONE Don't show the future
   Ext charts seem to sometimes show more than the data in the axis (jumps by chunks or something)
   Perhaps setting max to now or something like that
** TODO Ignore -1 in stale values
** DONE HRs in tooltips aren't the same width with long key names
** TODO Failure function for keys expand
   This is to prevent the loading circle from stayign there forever
** TODO Back button issue
** TODO Going back to no-graphs page
   When marking zero graphs in compare mode, then marking something, then going back to zero - the display doesn't update to the background picture correctly.
** TODO Misordered responses issue
   When requesting a graph  and then requesting a different graph - if the first one returns after the second, Muleview will display the first one :(
   We need to do some versioning of the requests sent (by order of the user selection) or add an ability to abort requests.
** TODO Refresh timer not reset by reloading graph
** DONE Retention names are wrong in combobox (missing "s")
** DONE Multimode seems to be broken
   Can't check keys
** DONE Can't open alerts editor in the same graph different retention
** DONE Alets - not all are shown
** DONE "Hide Legend" isn't toggled by default on single graphs
** DONE Retentions aren't saved when switching between keys
** DONE Graphs look awful in Firefox
** DONE Nicer sorting in alerts report
   There should be a way to sort by critical > warning > normal..
** DONE Default alerts
*** DONE Calculation should be based upon period
*** DONE Period should be bigger
    We should start with bucket * 3
** DONE Alert lines in charts should be thicker
   Perhaps even some marker on the side?
** DONE Fix status bar
*** DONE Auto clear
*** DONE Icons
** DONE Alerts Editor
*** DONE "Save" When the alert is initially turned off doesn't work
    This is because the default values are invalid + hidden
*** DONE Add default values
    According to the current chart data...
*** DONE Tooltip issue
    The error tooltip is broken
** DONE Don't pull all retentions per graph
** DONE Renovate Alerts Report
   Should be a different window or something
   ----
   I went for the mini dock implementation
** DONE Nicer formatting of stale/period values in alerts report
** DONE Mask when switching retentions in the same graph
** DONE Navigation in compare-mode
** DONE Status bar doesn't have busy icon
   Also, it should utilize Ext.Ajax.is(something, loading or waiting or something like that)
   ---------------------
   I end up implementing it with an array of request ids
** DONE Fix statusbar auto fade
it gets into "ready" even though still waiting for mule events
** DONE Coffee 1.6 compatibility
** DONE "Loading" mask has double icons
** DONE Subkeys pagination
*** DONE Handle case when no subkeys
*** DONE Disable subkeys selector when no subkeys
** DONE prettier combobox in chart viewer
** DONE AlertsEditor not complete
** DONE The tool tip over the stack graph shows the % sign with no value
** DONE Times should be shown in UTC

* Features:
** DONE Move axis to outside of chart
** TODO Have a close button on the legend itself
** DONE Unify two parts of the (mouseover) status
** TODO Add combo box to MuleTimeField
   Instead of using the regex, have a combo with ["Seconds", "Minutes", ...]
** TODO Bette distinguish main key tooltip and subkey tooltip (and alerts, too?)
** TODO Add error handling to request functions
** DONE Easy way to show only main key (hide all subkeys)
** TODO Editable Settings
   There should be a way to edit the settings, perhaps even persist to the browser and/or import/export settings files
** TODO Nicer about box?
   perhaps, god forbig, an image or something?
** DONE Pointer cursor for clickable areas
** DONE Color alert fieldLabels
** TODO Configurable refresh
** TODO Support for timestamp labels - Waiting for Mule API
   Probably can't implement in Ext Chart :(
** TODO Something cooler with tooltips?
** TODO Theme
*** DONE Favicon
*** DONE Areas color pallete
*** DONE Nicer Mule Background
"The mule picture should at least have the full "l" letter. I think it looks more like a bull than a mule so maybe adding another ear or a face will work."

*** TODO Different color for topKey and areas
*** DONE Less ugly keysTree icons
    I simply removed them.
** TODO Maximize/restore button
** DONE Fix Tooltip Errors somehow
** DONE Lexicographic order of keys
** DONE Add value field to main key tooltip
** DONE Remove "GMT" from tooltip timestamp
** DONE Implement "Average Alerts" instead of meaningless alert lines in charts
** DONE Add automatic retries for requests
** DONE Implement children
   In the keys tree - show + sign next to keys which are known to have subkeys.
** DONE Loading mask when loading keys
** DONE Url Navigation:
*** DONE Fix history-landing keys Tree
When entering Muleview with a graph url, the keys-tree doesn't update nicely.p
It should immediately show the full path of the key, and then subsequently load the full tree up to the root
** DONE Color pallete
** DONE Dymamic Tree improvements:
*** DONE Show loading mask in node itself
** DONE The x-axis contains full time stamps which can be too much for the eye. What about showing the day only when they change?
I hope this fix is suitable (Not trivial to check).
** DONE We should add some branding to the status bar. Maybe the project name and a link to github?
** DONE Alert dashboard - a summary of the alert statuses. Navigating to the faulty graphs would be great.
** DONE When presenting single graphs (i.e. not stacked) the lines should be thicker.
** DONE Add an option to reset the zoom factor
** DONE Toggle Legend
** DONE Mule/Hinny picture
** DONE Something nicer with the status bar
   Added alert status
   Can always add more events to reportin the sb...
** DONE Redesign display
 - [X] Only relevant small graphs
 - [X] Make small graphs clickable
** DONE Url navigation
** DONE Nicer title(s)
** DONE Status Bar
** DONE Refresh interval
** DONE Click to zoom graphs
** DONE Refresh button
** DONE Improve progress bar
 - [X] Overlay only on main panel
** DONE Shorter key names in legend
** DONE Alerts:
*** DONE Display lines on graphs
 - [X] Show lines
 - [X] Design lines
 - [X] Get rid of legend line markers
*** DONE Enable configuration
 - [X] Save
 - [X] Read
 - [X] Stale/Period:
   - [X] Save
   - [X] Read
   - [X] Special controller / Validations
*** DONE Enable removing alerts
*** DONE Do not show fields when not alerts
aka "Add alerts" button
*** DONE Nicer tips
*** DONE Load alerts with graph
* Optimizations:
** TODO Try to implement onhashchange event myself
This is related to histoy controller
** DONE Dynamic tree
** DONE Utilize numchilds
** DONE Don't pull all graph data, only relevant retention
** DONE Generate big chart only on demand
** DONE Upgrade to Extjs 4.2
* Misc:
** TODO Fix rare tootip "surface" error davar
** DONE Check data correctness
   --------
   Seems legit AFAIK
** DONE Support for more than 2-3 retentions?
** DONE Refactor / naming, "Graph" object
 - Graph object will contain references to 2 charts + alerts
 - Distinguish "chart", "graph" and "retention"
 ---------
 Close enough
** DONE Get rid of Muleview.Events
in favor of this.application.whatever
** Ideas:
*** Experiment with union-graph
One graph to rule them all ( all retentions )
*** PASS - Experiment with single graph component
the single graph component is a panel containing a chart and can have two viewing mode - big and light
Think i'll pass this one
*** PASS - Experiment with docked buttons instead of a tab bar
*** Experiment with tree-grid
Instead of having regular tree + tabs, use tree-grid, which will hold 3 (?) buttons for each node, button per graph/retention
PASS - since I eventually implemented compare mode.
*** Color tree keys according to what they appear in the legend
*** Use Google charts instead of Extjs
    It looks nicer
*** Slideshow
Add an option to save and manage a list of graphs and when played, switch between them with an interval
Now even easier in compare-mode checkboxes
*** Split Screen
Add an option to see 4 or 9 graphs at the same time
Now even easier in compare-mode checkboxes
