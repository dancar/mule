** Ideas:
*** TODO Experiment with union-graph

the single graph component is a panel containing a chart and can have two viewing mode - big and light
*** TODO Experiment with docked buttons instead of a tab bar
*** TODO Experiment with tree-grid
Instead of having regular tree + tabs, use tree-grid, which will hold 3 (?) buttons for each node, button per graph/retention
