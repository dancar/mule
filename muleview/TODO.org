When entering Muleview with a graph url, the keys-tree doesn't update nicely.p
It should immediately show the full path of the key, and then subsequently load the full tree up to the root

it gets into "ready" even though still waiting for mule events
** TODO Dymamic Tree improvements:
*** TODO Show loading mask in node itself

** TODO Color pallete
** TODO "This key has no graphs"
Not sure this is a reasonable situation, though

* Optimizations:
** DONE Dynamic tree
** TODO Generate big chart only on demand
** TODO Smooth refresh
Refrehs instead of completely destroy and recreated all graphs - ask for updated data and when received, replace existing.
both in refresh button and alerts editor
* Misc:
** TODO Check data correctness
** TODO Support for more than 2-3 retentions?
** TODO Refactor / naming, "Graph" object
 - Graph object will contain references to 2 charts + alerts
 - Distinguish "chart", "graph" and "retention"
** TODO Get rid of Muleview.Events
in favor of this.application.whatever
** Ideas:
*** TODO Experiment with union-graph
One graph to rule them all ( all retentions )
*** TODO Experiment with single graph component
the single graph component is a panel containing a chart and can have two viewing mode - big and light
Think i'll pass this one
*** TODO Experiment with docked buttons instead of a tab bar
*** TODO Experiment with tree-grid
Instead of having regular tree + tabs, use tree-grid, which will hold 3 (?) buttons for each node, button per graph/retention
*** TODO Color tree keys according to what they appear in the legend
